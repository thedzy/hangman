## Why?
While, I am sure this has been done to death.  The world can always use another hangman challenge.  No, that's not why.  Partially just looking for a something to code and I wanted to create a proper "hangman" and the challenge of creating and storing that art.

## Improvements?
I think a basic b&w image converter to the stored graphics, maybe online mode.  What can you really do with an early childhood game like this? 3D?

## State?
No known bugs.  Works.

# New
## 1.1
- Added continuous mode
- Added support for special characters
- Defaults to oxford 5000 so that the words are not complete unknowns
- Included oxford 3000 for easier play
