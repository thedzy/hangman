# [The Oxford 3000 and the Oxford 5000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/wordlists/oxford3000-5000)

## What is the Oxford 3000?
The Oxford 3000 is a list of the 3,000 core words that
every learner of English needs to know.

The words have been chosen based on their frequency in the Oxford English Corpus
and relevance to learners of English. Every word is aligned to the CEFR, guiding
learners on the words they should know at A1-B2 level.

## What is the Oxford 5000?
The Oxford 5000 is an expanded core word list for
advanced learners of English.

As well as the Oxford 3000 core word list, it includes an additional 2,000 words
that are aligned to the CEFR, guiding advanced learners at B2-C1 level on the
most useful high-level words to learn to expand their vocabulary.


### Selecting the words
---
The words in the Oxford 3000 and 5000 have been selected based on two criteria:
- the frequency of the words in the Oxford English Corpus, a database of over 2
billion words from different subject areas and contexts which covers British,
American and world English.

- the relevance of the words to English language learners, measured by their
frequency in a specially created corpus of Secondary and Adult English courses
published by Oxford University Press. This means that the lists cover the words
that learners will come across in class and in their study texts.


### Validated by experts
---
The Oxford 3000 was developed in consultation with James Milton, Professor of
Applied Linguistics, Swansea University, UK, and reviewed by Paul Nation,
Emeritus Professor in Applied Linguistics, Victoria University of Wellington,
New Zealand.

**Reviews**

‘When I started using the Oxford 3000 with my students… I wasn’t sure how
students would respond to these activities. I found that they seem to like the
routine and recognise the value of working with the Oxford 3000 word list.’
*_ Bjorn Candel, EFL teacher*

### In the dictionary
---
On this website, the words are listed alphabetically. You can
browse the words, search for a word, filter the list, and download them. The
CEFR level is shown beside each word, and you can hear the word pronounced in
either British or American English.

Every definition in the [Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english) is written using
words from the Oxford 3000, making it easier for users of these lists to look up
and understand the definitions.
